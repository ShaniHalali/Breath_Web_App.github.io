# 🌬️ Breath Web App

Welcome to the **Breath Web App** – a calming and interactive website thoughtfully **developed by our five inspiring 8th-grade mentees, guided and supported by us, their mentors – **Shani Halali(me)** and **Hadar Dabush****.  
This project was created as part of the **QUEEN B** program – a non-profit initiative where Computer Science students mentor middle school girls and teach them how to code.

Together, Hadar and I taught the girls all the coding concepts and principles that led to the creation of the final product – the Breath Web App.
The web app is designed to help users take a mindful pause, reduce stress, and includes a powerful **SOS feature** for emergencies.

## 🌟 About the Project

This website was developed during a mentoring programming activity and submitted as our final **Hackathon project**.

**The goal: solve a real social problem.**

In light of the recent situation in Israel and the rising cases of **post-trauma among youth**, the girls wanted to build a safe digital space –  
a simple, beautiful, and meaningful tool to help users breathe, calm down, and guide themselves or others during moments of stress.

The app also includes an **SOS button**, which displays emergency contact information that the user pre fills. This information can be accessed from any page in the app – either by the user or someone nearby who wants to help.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structuring the website  
- **CSS3** – for layout, styling, and animations
